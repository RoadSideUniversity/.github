## Hi there 👋

可能第一步是让朋友们有使用GitHub的能力和习惯。
这一建议非常好， 已经在根目录下建立了一个共同学习的目录 GitHub101， 请各位在GitHub101下自建子目录，请清晰命名，开放式分享。
各位同学可以follow，创建issue，或者创建discussion
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
